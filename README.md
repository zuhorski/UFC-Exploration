# Welcome to my UFC Exploration Repository!

As many new UFC fans, I became a regualr watcher of the UFC when covid happened and the world of sports was completely shut down. Thankfully, Dana White was there to save the day for sports fans and was able to pull off keeping the UFC operational. Now ive developed a major love for the sport. 

This repository is dedicated to digging deeper into the statistics of the UFC. As a Data Science major, soon to be graduate- 2023, I'm trying to put into practice what ive learned or been learning. Thanks for checking this out!
